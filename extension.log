{"level":"info","message":"Standardized Spec: Here's a standardized specification based on the provided natural language specification:\n\n### Function Specification for Calculating the Difference Between Two Numbers\n\n#### 1. Input Format with Variables and Constraints\n\n- **Input Variables:**\n  - `a`: An integer, where \\( a \\) represents one of the two numbers.\n  - `b`: An integer, where \\( b \\) represents the other number.\n\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Both `a` and `b` are integers. Typically, constraints may specify the range of these variables, such as \\( -10^9 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9 \\), to accommodate typical integer values under realistic conditions.\n\n#### 2. Output Format and Constraints\n\n- **Output:**\n  - The function should return a single integer, which is the result of \\( a - b \\).\n\n- **Constraints:**\n  - The output must also be an integer and should fall within the permissible integer range of the language used, typically \\(-10^{18}\\) to \\(10^{18}\\), unless otherwise specified.\n\n#### 3. Summary of Rules\n\n- The function takes two input integers, calculates their difference by subtracting the second integer `b` from the first integer `a`, and returns the result.\n- Ensure that input adheres to the specified constraints to avoid overflow or underflow scenarios.\n\n#### 4. Conditions\n\n- The implementation must handle edge cases, such as when `a` and `b` are both positive, both negative, one positive and one negative, or when one or both equal zero.\n\n#### 5. Time and Memory Limit\n\n- **Time Complexity:**\n  - The function must execute in constant time \\( O(1) \\) since it performs a simple arithmetic operation.\n  \n- **Memory Complexity:**\n  - The memory usage should also be minimal, essentially \\( O(1) \\), as only a few integer values are stored and computed.\n\n#### Example Input for Initial Seed\n\n- **Example 1:**\n  - Input: `a = 10`, `b = 3`\n  - Output: `7`\n\n- **Example 2:**\n  - Input: `a = -5`, `b = -10`\n  - Output: `5`\n\n- **Example 3:**\n  - Input: `a = 0`, `b = 0`\n  - Output: `0`\n\nThese examples can be used as test cases to validate the behavior and correctness of the implemented function.","timestamp":"2024-10-09T14:26:25.014Z"}

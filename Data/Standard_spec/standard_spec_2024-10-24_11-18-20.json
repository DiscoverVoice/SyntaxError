  "standardized_spec": "Below is the standardized specification based on the natural language specification provided:\n\n1. **Input Format and Constraints:**\n    - The function receives a string `s` of lowercase alphabets. \n    - The length of the string `s` is denoted by `n`.\n    - The value of `n` satisfies the constraints: `1 <= n <= 26`.\n    - The string `s` contains only unique characters with no repetitions.\n\n2. **Output Format and Constraints:**\n    - The output is a single integer denoting the number of possible permutations of any three characters from the string.\n    - The output must be non-negative and must fit within standard integer limits.\n\n3. **Summary of Rules:**\n    - The function calculates the number of ways to choose and order any three characters from a given string.\n    - Since characters are unique, this is a permutation problem.\n\n4. **Conditions:**\n    - You are to select 3 distinct characters from the string `s`.\n    - Calculate the number of possible ordered arrangements (permutations) for these three characters.\n\n5. **Time and Memory Limits:**\n    - The function should operate efficiently given that `n` is at most 26.\n    - The time complexity should ideally be O(1) since character processing is minimal with the constraints.\n    - Memory usage should also be minimal due to the limited input size.\n\n6. **Example Input for Initial Seed:**\n    - Example input string: `\"abcde\"`\n    - Expected output: `60`\n\n    *Explanation for the example:* For string `\"abcde\"`, choose 3 characters in `(5 choose 3) = 10` ways. Each selection of 3 characters can be permuted in `3! = 6` ways, thus `10 * 6 = 60` total permutations."

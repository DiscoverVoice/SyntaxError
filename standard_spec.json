Here is a detailed specification:\n\n1. **Input Format and Constraints:**\n   - **Input Variables:**\n     - `a`: An integer, representing the first number.\n     - `b`: An integer, representing the second number.\n   - **Constraints:**\n     - Both `a` and `b` should be within the range of 32-bit signed integers, i.e., \\(-2^{31} \\leq a, b \\leq 2^{31} - 1\\).\n\n2. **Output Format and Constraints:**\n   - **Output:**\n     - An integer representing the difference between `a` and `b` (i.e., \\(a - b\\)).\n   - **Constraints:**\n     - The result must be computed using integer arithmetic and should fit within a 32-bit signed integer range.\n\n3. **Summary of the Rules:**\n   - The function should take two integer inputs and return their difference.\n   - Ensure the calculation is efficient and runs within the constraints for standard integer operations.\n\n4. **Conditions:**\n   - The function must handle both positive and negative integers, including zero.\n   - Integer overflow should be considered if there are environment constraints that do not automatically handle large integers in the specified programming language.\n\n5. **Time and Memory Limits:**\n   - **Time Limit:** The function should execute in constant time, \\(O(1)\\), as it involves a simple arithmetic operation.\n   - **Memory Limit:** The function's memory usage should be minimal, primarily requiring storage for three integers (`a`, `b`, and their difference).\n\n6. **Example Input for Seed:**\n   - **Input Example:** `a = 10`, `b = 3`\n   - **Output Example:**\n     - Output: `7`\n     - Explanation: The difference \\(10 - 3\\) is calculated, resulting in \\(7\\).\n\nThis standardized specification outlines the requirements and constraints for implementing the function to calculate the difference between two numbers. It also includes an example to aid initial testing and validation of the function."

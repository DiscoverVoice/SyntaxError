      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand Constraints and Input:**\n",
      "   - Each customer can buy `x` different models.\n",
      "   - Calculate the total number of models, `n`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Determine Minimum Customers:**\n",
      "   - To sell all models, at least `n` customers are needed, because each customer can only buy different models.\n",
      "   - Calculate the additional customers needed for each model `a[i]` such that it can be sold considering the `x` maximum capacity per customer.\n",
      "   - Use a loop to iterate over each car model count in `a` and calculate how many customers are needed for that model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Calculate Total Customers:**\n",
      "   - For each car model `a[i]`, divide by `x` to determine the chunks of customers needed for that model.\n",
      "   - Sum up these required customer chunks to get the total minimum customers for each test case.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Output the Solution:**\n",
      "   - For each test case, print the minimum number of customers required.\n",
